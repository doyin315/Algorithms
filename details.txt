I need this scholarship because I perceive that the future is based on artificial intelligence. At a point, it will be machines making machines and doing a lot of the work that humans currently do today. This will make work, in general, to be efficient and as quick as possible since machines are capable of considering several possibilities and making decisions based on tons of statistical data far faster than humans can. I find this very exciting and interesting hence, my interest in the concept of artificial intelligence keeps on growing as I know more about it and this scholarship is a great opportunity for me to satisfy my curiosity and possibly build a career in artificial intelligence.
In my pursuit of knowledge, I taught myself coding. Languages I'm familiar with include python, javascript, and Java.I'm sure these skills will help me in this scholarship.
