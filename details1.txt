I am currently in the middle of my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering. After being taught the basics of programming, I decided to explore it beyond the classroom and i've been able to learn a lot of things. Although, concept of artificial intelligence has always intrigued me in a special way. My first impression of a machine being able to think for itself was sheer excitement. The main thought in my mind was "how is this possible and to what extent?".Ever since then it just kept on intriguing me even more. I see this scholarship as an opportunity to understand artificial intelligence and possibly be a pathway for a new career
